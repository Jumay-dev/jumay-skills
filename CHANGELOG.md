# Changelog

## 2026-07-09 — initial import

- Imported the working skill set as the version-control baseline, renamed
  `the company-prefixed originals` → `jumay-*`, and removed company-specific values (org/repo names,
  ticket prefixes, Slack channel and user IDs, reviewer names, machine-local
  paths) in favor of documented placeholders.
- `validate-pr-body.js`: the `owner/repo` argument is now required instead of
  defaulting to a hardcoded repository.
- Known optimization candidates (measured across six parallel runs, not yet
  applied):
  - Replace CI/review polling with blocking waits (`gh pr checks --watch`);
    polling dominated the 11–19M input tokens per run.
  - Move review-thread closeout to a post-final-CI gate verified by an
    unresolved-thread count query; agents treated "outdated" threads as closed
    and late review-bot threads were missed.
  - Capture component-cropped screenshots from the first visual iteration.
  - Pre-warm worktree setup (install/build caches) before fanning out a fleet.
